Polynomial Root Finder:

The two steps involved in finding the roots are:
Step one: Find the upper bound on the number of roots in the interval using Budan's Theorem.
Step two: If the upper bound is not zero, find them using Halley's method.

To compile the code, use the following command:

gcc -Wall -lm -g -o mp4 mp4.c
To run using the test cases, use
./mp4 testone.txt
